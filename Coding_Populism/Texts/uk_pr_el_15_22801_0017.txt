Nick has also announced that the adult National Minimum Wage will increase by three per cent to a new rate of £6.70 this October.

This is the largest real-terms increase in the National Minimum Wage since 2008 and is set to benefit more than 1.4m of Britain's lowest paid workers.

The increase in the apprentice National Minimum Wage will halve the gap with the rate for 16 to 17 year olds, which will increase by two per cent, from £3.79 to £3.87 per hour.

There will also be a three per cent increase in the rate for 18 to 20 year olds from £5.13 to £5.30 an hour.

Nick said:

“This is just one of the many ways in which we’ve created a fairer society whilst building a stronger economy. 

"If you work hard, this government is behind you all the way. Whether you’re on low pay or starting your dream career through an apprenticeship, you will get more support to help you go further and faster."
