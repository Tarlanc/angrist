[TS_Beginning]
Beginning of the story
Please note the timestamp of the beginning of this story/show as hh:mm:ss
The timestamps for the beginning and end of a story refer to the exact points in time at which a TV story starts or ends. The time data refer to the point of time within a recorded newscast. Collecting this information ensures traceability to the exact stories after the content analysis data have been collected.#Separation of news stories within one newscast: In one whole newscast, different news stories with different topics are presented. Normally the newscast begins with the most important and pressing events of the day (these can be political, economic, cultural, sport events etc.). All for the content analysis relevant news stories are coded separately after one another. There are different mechanisms how the different news stories are separated. Normally the newscast presenter introduces a new topic, which is followed either by presented pictures or video in the background, a full screening of a video cast or a life connection to another moderator or correspondent. Sometimes the beginning and the end of a new news story is not as clearly introduced by the moderator

[Author]
Who is the author of this text?
Please indicate the author
The author of a text refers to the person responsible for the content and presentation. In most cases the author is a journalist of the source in which the text has been published or a journalist of a news agency. In some cases, however, the source may be a private person, a politician, a reader (letters to the editor) or not mentioned at all. Since the names of the author is of no interest to the investigation of populism within the media, except if the person is a political actor, only the function of the author will be coded.##Journalist of the source:#This option subsumes all authors of journalist texts (newspaper, tv-shows, magazines) who are writing regularly for the newspaper. The option is to be chosen if:# - Only a monogram is used as source (except for press agency acronyms!)# - A full name without any biographical or otherwise additional information is given as a source##News Agency#News agencies may be identified by their acronyms or names. They include: SDA, AWP, AFP, CAPA, APS, Newspress, ANSA, AGI, ASCA, DAPD, DPA, DDP, DTS, PTE, SAD, AP, Bloomberg, IPS, Interfax, RTR(Reuters) ##Reader / Audience#This option may be chosen if the text is a reader's comment, a letter to the editor or a soundbite from the street.##National political actor#National political actors may be found in Appendices B to E: Actors. If any of these actors is the author of the text, this option is to be coded. This goes for:# - Guest authors which happen to be one of these actors# - Comments, Letters, Columns, or any other form of contribution by one of these actors# - All party manifestos (actor is the party)# - All press releases (actor is the party)##Other#Other guest authors than the speakers we investigate may be coded as other authors.##Not identifiable#If there is no acronym or name, the author is to be coded as not identifiable. Even if experience shows that these texts are usually from news agencies (best practice in 'Blick' and 'Blick am Abend'). All texts which do not provide any information on the author are coded using this option.

Type of the text
Which genre/category does this text belong to?
News story#Fact–oriented type of story, factual news report, report of events etc., of what has happened [when, where, who, what, why?], e.g., party meeting, report on recent events etc. Probably the most frequent type of news story.##Editorial/Column/Commentary/Letter to the editor#Most subjective kind of a news item in which authors give their personal interpretations and opinions: # - Editorial: Typically explicitly marked as editorial, opinion–piece, an article of its own, clearly defined to give evaluations, typically on same page within newspaper each time. It has to be formally distinct from the rest of the page. It clearly expresses a standpoint of the author/editor who again speaks for his newspaper. # - Column: clearly marked as special column, distinct from regular coverage, most likely always at the same place within news-paper, reoccurring item on a regular basis as fixed part of newspaper coverage, can be written in very personal style. # - Commentary: Often not written by a journalist but by an external source such as an expert, politician etc.; often explicitly marked as „commentary“, e.g. by guest author. Letter to the editor: written by a reader; referring to previous articles published in the newspaper and representing the personal opinion of the reader; mostly explicitly marked as letter to the editor and placed on a special page within the newspaper.##Interview#News item consisting of questions and answers shown or printed in direct quotes between interviewer and interviewee or between several discussants. Note: There have to be at least two interview questions (often in bold or italic) to justify coding an interview! Interview sections which are part of a „reportage“ or another more subjective report are not meant here.##Background report/Reportage/Portrait/Feature#More subjective reports in different forms: # - Feature article: Vivid report of a correspondent, named as the author of the article. # - A „reportage“ describes individual experience of the author; often explicitly marked as „reportage“.# - Background story: often longer article, not only factual reporting, looking behind the scenes, analytical, in–depth – not only descriptive, often explicitly marked as „analysis“, etc. Magazine style report: Type of news story in which elements of factual news reports and subjective elements intermingle. But: The journalist does not have to be on location, describing individual experience as in a reportage/background story.# - Portrait: Portrait of, e.g., a person, group, institution, organization – and nothing more than that. Otherwise it may be a news story or a reportage (see above).

[Genre_TV]
Type of news broadcast
What is the type of the story?
TV newscast may either be news stories (verbal or visual) or interviews, portrait or features. Please select the most appropriate. For Talkshows there is just one possibility.##Talkshow#Talkshows are in-studio shows with a moderator and one or more guests, usually set up in the form of a roundtable. Typically, they are centered around a concrete topic, question or policy which is discussed, often including people with differing viewpoints on the subject.##News story verbally	#A news story is one story from the typical flagship evening news broadcast that almost every TV broadcaster airs every day. Typically, these news broadcasts last between half an hour and a full hour and they are functional equivalents in different countries, thus lending themselves to be used as an object of international comparison. #In comparison to a visual news story, this option is coded when the news story is only presented verbally by the moderator or the anchorman in the broadcast studio. If some pictures are shown in the background of the studio, this option is also coded.##News story visual#In comparison with an only verbally presented news story, this option is coded, when the news story is presented as audio-visual material, which was edited before by the news broadcaster. This type of news story is mostly announced by the anchorman or moderator and followed by a taped video which does not show the studio any more.##Interview / Portrait / Feature#Within news broadcasts, sometimes there will be specific interviews, portraits or features (for example with politicians, scientists, etc.) regarding the same topic as a previous news story (also see Timestamps for further clarifications about this). In those instances, they are long enough to form separate stories from the newscast, thus we code their genre as interviews. Also live coverage interviews or features are coded in this option.

[Main_Issue]
Which is the main issue of this text?
Choose the most appropriate issue from the list below. In case of a combination, select more than one.
You may select the issues from the list by scrolling or by typing some letters to the text entry at the top of the list. Confirm by pressing 'att item' or by hitting the return-key.##Definition:#In this codebook, issues are defined as discrete but broad policy fields in which a political debate may take place. In sum, 125 issues are defined and may be clustered to 14 broader topics such as welfare, environment or elections. #In addition to political issues there are two broader topics (events and election) which may also be discussed by actors without linking it to political issues. Items from these categories must not be coded if any political issue is applicable. The main issue of a text may only be an event or the election if no political issue is mentioned prominently within the text. When in doubt, always select the most prominent political issue over events and the election.#In other words: Events are only to be coded if the issue of the statement (or text) is a singlular and specific event.# - If the event is only used to exemplify an issue, the issue is coded. # - If en event is only used as a special case within the issue, the issue is coded. # - If the event is only an occasion on which an issue may be debated, the issue is coded.##While individual policies or debates may be located in one particular policy field or issue, the scope of texts may be larger. Especially in newspaper articles, the number of issues which may be covered by the journalist varies strongly. If more than one issue is present in a text, pleas select the most central one which all other issues are linked to. The main issue should be:# - Mentioned in the Title of the text# - Mentioned in the lead of the text# - Be elaborated most thoroughly of all issues in the text# - Any combination of the points above.

[Frame_HI]
Human Interest Framing
Does the text provide any of the following characteristics?
Definition:#A human interest frame is set, when a human face is brought into the text. Such a frame refers to an effort to personalize the news in order to capture and retain audience interest. Sometimes the human face is not only mentioned but its connection to the issue or problem is explained in more detail. That is, it is emphasized how the individual or a certain group is affected by the issue or problem. Also personal vignettes or sketches of certain individuals and/or their lives can be mentioned. These can sometimes include adjectives expressing feelings of outrage or feelings of sympathy, caring and compassion. ##Please note: Also a story about a political actor may serve a human interest frame. Yet, this is only the case if the political actor is portrayed as a human and not as a politician. That is, a human touch or human factor has to be connected to that political actor. If the story only provides insights of the private life of the political actor, do not code human interest frame. This codebook provides a “Private Life”-category for this case.  ##A “human face” or human example on the issue: Does the story provide a human example or “human face” on the issue? Yes, if a concrete individual is simply connected to an issue without any further elaboration about possible consequences. This can also be a politician who is portrayed as a human and not as a politician.  ##Details on how individuals are affected by the issue/problem: Does the story emphasize how individuals and groups are affected by the issue/problem? Yes, if it is explained how a concrete individual or group (a certain part of the population such as the youth, the poor, the rich, workers, families, immigrants etc.) is affected (in terms of consequences) by an issue/problem (e.g. consequences for their everyday lifes). ##Adjectives or personal vignettes expressing feelings of dislike, antipathy, objection: Does the story employ adjectives or personal vignettes that express feelings of dislike, antipathy, objection? This might concern politicians as well es non politicians or certain groups. ##Adjectives or personal vignettes expressing feelings sympathy, caring, compassion: Does the story employ adjectives or personal vignettes that express sympathy, caring, compassion? This might concern politicians as well es non politicians or certain groups.
face:A "human face" or human example on the issue
indi:Details on how individuals/groups are affected by the issue/problem
emoN:Adjectives or personal vignettes expressing feelings of dislike, antipathy, objection
emoP:Adjectives or personal vignettes expressing feelings sympathy, caring, compassion


[Frame_Con]
Conflict Framing
Does the text provide any of the following characteristics?
This frame emphasizes conflict between individuals, groups, or institutions. The setting of conflicts in texts can have different characteristics: The text can simply reflect a disagreement between parties, individuals, groups or countries. Sometimes it is mentioned that one actor reproaches another actor for causing certain problems. Even winners or losers with respect to the issue can be pointed out within a text.#A conflict frame can also be set when the text displays two or more possible points of view concerning an issue. This is already done, when a disagreement between actors is displayed (see above). Yet sometimes the reporting is unbalanced and only the argument of one actor is fully explained while the argument of the other actor gets less room within the news story, is displayed incomplete and/or slanted in a mere negative way. ##Disagreement between actors (parties/individuals/groups/countries):#The news story mainly displays a disagreement between two or more actors. In this case perspectives of both actors are displayed and it is shown that these perspectives are divergent. It is said that one actor does not agree/disagrees with the other or that one actor has a different perspective/view concerning an issue. Attempts, initiation, completion of dispute, disagreement, discordance, confrontation, clashing positions and views or controversy are displayed. An actor can also dismiss ideas/arguments of another actor to express disagreement. ##Reproach of an actor toward another:#Choose this code when the news story contains a number of reproaches between two or more actors: One actor blames another actor for doing something wrong/immoral or for not taking measures at all though responsible. This can also contain offences or insults or sideswipes at somebody. ##Winners and losers with respect to the issue:#The newsstory displays winners and/or losers with respect to an issue when the story contains talk about success or triumph of one actor over another, or talk about somebody being defeated or beaten by somebody else. Also somebody could concede defeat or throw in the cards. ##Unbalanced:#Two or more uneven sides/Slant: When a conflict is displayed in a text (e.g. by informing about winners and losers with respect to the issue) this may be done in a balanced or unbalanced way. You can use this code to indicate, wheter die conflict was represented balanced (do not code in this case) or wheter it was represented with a slant (code “unbalanced” in this case). #A slant is evident, when only the argument of one actor is fully explained while the argument of the other actor gets less room within the news story, is displayed incomplete or not at all and/or slanted in a mere negative way. Sometimes an article contains only/mainly statements of actors that agree with a certain issue but no actor is cited who disagrees with a certain issue.

repr:Reproach of an actor toward another
winn:Winners and losers with respect to the issue

[Frame_PRF]
Which of the following reporting functions are used in the story to portray politics?
Please indicate whether the functions are only present or dominating
Definition:#A news story about politics may be presented in four forms: conduit frame, context frame, interpretative frame and/or accountability frame. These forms differ in terms of the depth of political analysis or the provided service or performance by the journalist himself. The basic or fundamental level of journalistic service is provided by the conduit frame; the most sophisticated service is provided by the accountability frame. The context frame and interpretative frame are to be seen as inbetween the two other frames. Accoringly, these four types represent a hierarchy of levels of political analysis. For example, the accountability frame will most likely (yet not necessarily!) contain elements of the conduit frame, the context frame and the interpretative frame. #Be aware that the forms differ only by complexity or by the amount of provided journalistic service yet not necessarily by the quality of journalistic work! The conduit frame can be of high quality just as the accountability frame – yet the informative functions each frame can fulfill are different ones and only this function has to be coded here.  ##A journalist can fulfill all four kinds of reporting function within one single article. Therefore you may differentiate between a frame that is only present (only occurs once in a short text or twice in a longer text) or if it is dominant (frame is displayed by more then half of the text). ##Conduit Frame:#Passive transmission of politicians’ messages and communication strategies. Journalist serves mainly as transmitter of information. This approach of conveying and disseminating information with no specific intention other than being a chronicler of events reflects the statements and communication strategies of political actors (populist or otherwise) in descriptive terms, without deeper background, further interpretation or critical analysis.#Indicators: # - direct speech # - information taken directly from press releases/press conferences or press release itself# - information presented with no remarks by the journalist##Context Frame:#Contextualized coverage of politicians‘ messages and communication strategies. Story places statements/events in context and provides additional background information. The context frame presents more information, more viewpoints and perspectives than the conduit frame but stays merely informational (no interpretation and analysis). #Indicators: # - embedding of new information in contextual information# - references to earlier or forthcoming events# - naming of causes/reasons for actions# - naming of different possible perspectives on issues/actors# - transitions between paragraphs by journalist# - transfer of political knowledge ##Interpretive Frame:#In addition to contextual information, the story provides journalistic interpretation, own perspective, meaning, opinion. It offers explanations, opinions, commentary, assumptions about motives and reasons, and aims to answer why something has happened. It may also speculate about future developments. Story uses more value-laden terms and (implicit or explicit) expressions of opinion than the context frame. It also provides more indications of how the journalist (or the news outlet) stands toward the story’s core theme than the context frame. #Indicators: # - speculation/assumptions/conjectures about actors’ behavior and issues# - opinions of the journalist (or news outlet)# - comments by the journalist##Accountability Frame: #In addition to contextual or interpretative information, the story offers wider lessons and deeper insights about politics and political communication. “Accountability frames” in news stories discuss political actions within the context of democratic functioning (e.g., how far publicity actors fulfill their role as instruments of democracy.) It addresses serious issues, alerts citizens of important (or potentially dangerous) developments, and provides multiple perspectives and deep background. The style of writing is elaborate, argumentative, rational, original and revealing. It often includes statements or arguments of experts. This approach would be critical toward populist communication styles (by politicians, media, and others) and try to deconstruct them, critically examine their practices, and expose their motives and implications.#Indicators: # - critical analysis of political actions and statements including explanation of motives and subsequent consequences and with reference to democratic functioning: effects on quality of the political discourse, quality of democracy, on questions of legitimacy and accountability of political communication actors, on election atmosphere and political culture, on voters attitudes toward politicians and the political system, on participation and turn-out, on involvement of voter segments or societal groups

[Frame_Neg]
Negativity Frame by the journalist
Does the text provide any of the following characteristics?
Definition:#A negative frame can only be set by the journalist and not by other speakers that can be indicated in the text. The journalist can either be negative towards developments, issues, situations or policies in general or towards certain political actors or towards other actors. ##You may differentiate between negativity that is only present (only occurs once in a short text or twice in a longer text) or negativity that is displayed dominantly (frame is displayed by more then half of the text). To indicate that the journalist is negative in general, understood as the journalist’s aggregated summary description of all relevant actors, statements, and issues being labeled as a problem you may code all of the three negativity frames as being present and/or dominant.##Negative tone toward developments/issues/situations/policies:#Does the report convey primarily negative impression of developments, issues, situations or policies? Indications of negative tonality are the framing of the story as political failure, fiasco, disaster, crisis, frustration, collapse, flop, denial, rejection, neglect, default, deterioration, resignation, skepticism, threats, cynicism, defeatism or disappointment. ##Critique and Scepticism toward politicians:#Does the report convey primarily a negative/critical impression of a specific political actor/political institution? Indications of a prevalent negative tone toward a specific political actor are depictions of individual failure, fiasco, disaster, crisis, frustration, collapse, flop, denial, rejection, neglect, default, deterioration, resignation, skepticism, threats, cynicism, defeatism or disappointment##Critique and Scepticism toward other actor:#Does the report convey primarily a negative/critical impression of a specific other actor/insitituion/group (e.g. immigrants, CEOs or NGOs)? Indications of a prevalent negative tone toward a specific other actor are depictions of individual failure, fiasco, disaster, crisis, frustration, collapse, flop, denial, rejection, neglect, default, deterioration, resignation, skepticism, threats, cynicism, defeatism or disappointment.

##For each country a list of political actors is composed which are the main objects of this analysis. These actors include a list of persons and a list of parties and organizations. For each party/organization a single person or the organization as a whole (i.e: the official spokesperson, the website, the social media account) may be considered a speaker.#In addition to this country-specific list a list of global actors is provided which includes the most important global organizations and actors. These actors may be considered speaker in any country. ##Any speaker or official spokesperson of an organization is coded as the organization itself. Speakers are not considered individual actors but just the mouthpiece of a collective actor.##If a speaker is not found on the list, he is coded as “other actor”. There are several sub-categories for other actors, such as all relevant parties of a country (e.g., other actor SVP), experts, normal people etc. If none of them applies, “other actor, partyless” has to be coded.

Often, some statements of a speaker are quoted directly and others indirectly. Sometimes, indirect quotations contain single words in quotation marks. In this case, code mixed citation. ##Since indirect quotations are paraphrased by the journalist, original rhetorical and style elements may be lost in the text.

############### Statement on Issue
###############

[Iss_ID]
Which issue is the actor talking about?
Please select the most appropriate issue from the list. You may select further issues later.
As with issues on the first level of analysis, issues of the actor's statement are defined as policy domains or societal questions in which a political debate may take place. Each issue an actor is talking about in his statement is coded separately with regards to the exact position and elaboration by the actor.#Usually, the statements of actors are short enough to be associated with exactly one issue. In certain circumstances, where the actor mentions several issues, there may be three different cases which are treated individually:##Case 1: The speaker mentions an issue and later mentions a different issue. In this case, both issues are coded individually.##Case 2: The speaker mentions a combined issue which unifies two of the sub-issues which may be selected (e.g: Family Welfare for immigrants / Fostering research on the future of economic liberalism). In this case, both issues the actor is linking may be coded together. The position and elaboration of the actor will, however, only be coded with regards to the first of these issues. For this reason, the issue selected first has to be the main issue of the statement.##Case 3: The speaker mentions a first issue which has an overlap with a second issue. The focus, however, lies definitely on the first issue and is not limited to the overlap. In this case, only the first issue is coded.##Case 4: The speaker mentions a bunch of issues without any elaboration, either isolated or as a part of an actor evaluation. This may especially happen in the course of election campaigns where statements such as "The government has failed to deal sensitively with the immigration problem, the social welfare and national exports." #In this case, DO NOT CODE. Only code issues which are elaborated.##Case 5: Causal chains: In some cases, a development within an issue has direct effects on another issue (e.g. immigration leads to financial strain on the welfare system). In these cases it may be difficult to decide whether the issue is the cause and the speaker elaborates on its consequences or whether the issue is the consequence and the elaboration includes causes. In these cases three rules should be applied to determine the issue:# - The issue is the part of the causal chain toward which the actor is expressing a position.# - If there is no position toward any part of the chain, the most elaborated part is considered the issue.#If there is no position and no elaboration on any part, the issue is the part of the chain which is more prominent within the text (either the main issue or an issue other actors make statements on as well).##Case 6: Chamäleon: Sometimes an issue may be coded as two or three different issues, depending on the point of view. These issues must not be coded as an overlap of all issues that might be coded.#Instead, you have to decide for the most appropriate issue. For this purpose, refer to the top-level of possible issues (broad categories). First, decide on the top-level it should belong to and then select for the most appropriate category within this policy field.#In this analysis, there is a strict hierarchy which may help you with this decision:# - The Top-Level 'Europe' is always to be preferred to all other issues.# - The Top-Level 'Elections' is never to be preferred to other issues.# - The Top-Level 'Events' is never to be preferred to other issues.##This means that the immigration of persons from the european union due to free movement of persons is always to be coded as 'europe - free movement of persons' and never as an immigration-issue.


[Iss_Elab]
Does the actor elaborate on this issue?
Please indicate what the actor is talking about within this issue
An issue may just be named by the speaker without any elaboration on specific problems, causes or consequences or it may be put in a frame of reference. The degree to which an actor elaborates on an issue may be measured by assessing the completeness of the frame of reference used.#For each issue a set of constituents of these frames may be coded for presence or absence. These components are:# - Problem definition and development# - Causes for a problem# - Consequences of a problem# - Specific cases or policies# - Attribution power to act actors##Attention: The elaboration is always focused on the issue which is coded, not on the consequences, causes or policies linked to it. This is especially important when coding policies/plans. Often, causes, responsibilities, or effects of plans to be taken, are mentioned. Since this elaboration is only focused on the policy and not on the situation or development of the issue, however, they must not be coded as elaboration. Instead, these contents may be coded as part of the argumentation and justification of the position of the speaker.##Problem definition/situation:#When talking about an issue the speaker may mention one concrete problem within this issue. This problem definition may be made in three different ways all of which are coded in this category:# - Quantitative specification: The speaker gives a quantitative specification of a problem by explicitly naming the rate of unemployment, the crime rate, the number of affected persons, or the duration of a problem.# - Concrete Case: The speaker gives a concrete example of a problem within this issue or an event which occurred in this issue. Single cases of affected persons are not counted as concrete case as they are coded individually (single case/affected individuals)# - Qualitative Problem: The speaker highlights a problem by stating moral, conceptual, or political problems he sees with it.##Development of a problem/situation:#When talking about an issue the speaker may give context to his statement by including information on the past development of this issue or a concrete problem within this issue. This development may either be described quantitatively (i.e. change of unemployment rate / number of immigrants) or qualitatively (i.e. worsening or relaxation). Any reference to a time-dependent change within the issue in the past or up to the present state is coded in this category. The “development of a problem or situation” is always retrospective, looking at the past and how it influenced the current situation. For future developments, code effects/consequences.##Single case/affected individuals:#This category is to be coded if the speaker mentions a person affected by this issue. The individual may thereby be named or referred to as 'a case' or 'a woman'.##Impersonal causes for a problem/development:#When talking about a current situation or development, the speaker may give reasons for it. These reasons may either be structural reasons or personal responsibilities. There are two different impersonal causes which are coded here:# - Causal Chain / Direct effect: The situation/development may be presented as a direct effect of another development/situation.# - Context Factors / Structural: The situation/development may be caused by the structural or political context of the country. This context includes abstract concepts such as 'capitalism', 'free market', 'socialism', 'fascist history'.##Personal responsibility for a problem/situation:#When talking about a current situation or development, the speaker may give reasons for it. These reasons may either be structural reasons or personal responsibilities. Personal responsibilities are coded when the cause for a situation, problem, or development is a person or organization.##Specific consequences/effects:#Any reference to consequences, effects or future developments of an issue, problem or situation are coded in this category. This includes effects this issue has on other issues, persons or context factors. This category is close to “development of a problem/situation” above, but it is not the same: the “development” focuses on the problem itself and how it developed over time, while “consequences” focuses on the effects this problem has on other issues, persons or context factors. It might happen often that they need to be coded together, for example when a politician assesses how a situation developed and what effects this might have for other fields; additionally, a politician might recommend his personal solution (i.e., a policy) to solve the problem, which would be the additional category “specific treatment/policy” (below).##Specific treatment/policy:#When making a statement on an issue the actor may do this by explicitly naming a policy or reform which is debated at the moment. Likewise, the speaker may propose a treatment or course of action to relieve a problem or change a development. All references to policies, treatments or plans are coded in this category.##Attribution/Denial of power to actors:#When elaborating on an issue, situation, development or specific policy a speaker may appoint actors which should be included in the future handling of this issue. Thereby the speaker gives and denies power or responsibility to act, decide, or participate to different actors.#If any such attribution or denial of power is present, this category has to be coded. The concrete actors and the denial or attribution of power are then coded in category "Attributing/Denying power".

Single cases of affected persons are not counted as concrete case as they are coded individually (single case/affected individuals)# - Qualitative Problem: The speaker highlights a problem by stating moral, conceptual, or political problems he sees with it.##Development of a problem/situation:#When talking about an issue the speaker may give context to his statement by including information on the past development of this issue or a concrete problem within this issue. This development may either be described quantitatively (i.e. change of unemployment rate / number of immigrants) or qualitatively (i.e. worsening or relaxation). Any reference to a time-dependent change within the issue in the past or up to the present state is coded in this category. The “development of a problem or situation” is always retrospective, looking at the past and how it influenced the current situation. For future developments, code effects/consequences.##Single case/affected individuals:#This category is to be coded if the speaker mentions a person affected by this issue. The individual may thereby be named or referred to as 'a case' or 'a woman'.##Impersonal causes for a problem/development:#When talking about a current situation or development, the speaker may give reasons for it. These reasons may either be structural reasons or personal responsibilities. There are two different impersonal causes which are coded here:# - Causal Chain / Direct effect: The situation/development may be presented as a direct effect of another development/situation.# - Context Factors / Structural: The situation/development may be caused by the structural or political context of the country. This context includes abstract concepts such as 'capitalism', 'free market', 'socialism', 'fascist history'.##Personal responsibility for a problem/situation:#When talking about a current situation or development, the speaker may give reasons for it. These reasons may either be structural reasons or personal responsibilities. Personal responsibilities are coded when the cause for a situation, problem, or development is a person or organization.##Specific consequences/effects:#Any reference to consequences, effects or future developments of an issue, problem or situation are coded in this category. This includes effects this issue has on other issues, persons or context factors. This category is close to “development of a problem/situation” above, but it is not the same: the “development” focuses on the problem itself and how it developed over time, while “consequences” focuses on the effects this problem has on other issues, persons or context factors. It might happen often that they need to be coded together, for example when a politician assesses how a situation developed and what effects this might have for other fields; additionally, a politician might recommend his personal solution (i.e., a policy) to solve the problem, which would be the additional category “specific treatment/policy” (below).##Specific treatment/policy:#When making a statement on an issue the actor may do this by explicitly naming a policy or reform which is debated at the moment. Likewise, the speaker may propose a treatment or course of action to relieve a problem or change a development. All references to policies, treatments or plans are coded in this category.##Attribution/Denial of power to actors:#When elaborating on an issue, situation, development or specific policy a speaker may appoint actors which should be included in the future handling of this issue. Thereby the speaker gives and denies power or responsibility to act, decide, or participate to different actors.#If any such attribution or denial of power is present, this category has to be coded. The concrete actors and the denial or attribution of power are then coded in category "Attributing/Denying power".

[Act_Appoint]
Which actor does the speaker GIVE competence to act or decide?
To which actor does the speaker attribute the ability/responsibility/power to act or decide?
When discussing the role of certain actors in the future handling of an issue, a speaker may attribute the power to act or to decide to different actors. In the same course the speaker may deny the same to other actors. By doing this, the speaker often gives a detailed description of how the future political course should look like and who should be included or excluded from it.#In this content analysis, the often complex relations of responsibilities and degrees of power are measured on a very low and abstract level. All information on power structures is reduced to two concrete informations: The appointment and denial of power, ability, or responsibility.##The people#There are two different ways to attribute power to the people. First, it is possible to attribute power to the people directly by stating that the citizens/people/common persons should be able to decide on an issue. Second, where institutionally possible, the call for a public vote or petition is also to be interpreted as an attribution of power to the people.#Conversely, a call for less referenda/petitions on an issue may be coded as a denial of power to the people.##The government / executive#The government may be attributed power by the demand for clear regulations from the government.##The Parliament / legislative#The parliament may be attributed power by explicitly stating that a decision should be reached in the parliament. ##Other Political Actor#If power is attributed or denied to a party or another political actor that is not part of the government and/or parliament, this category has to be coded. Furthermore, also if a party that is present in the parliament is not discussed in terms of their legislative function, use this category. If somebody speaks about “the politicians/politics in general”, also use this category. If it is no political actor whatsoever, please use the residual “other” category.##Unspecific Elite#In some cases, a speaker may just shift the responsiblity or power up toward unspecific elite. This is the case when one states that there are people in higher positions or people paid for it that should reach a decision or take an action. Usually, these are “nicknames” that people understand, for example in the EU: “Brussels has decided that we need to do…”; in Switzerland, a good example is the “classe politique”. ##Experts#Experts may be all kinds of academics, think tanks, public and private research facilities and other specialized institutions outside the political system. Power may be attributed to these institutions or persons by demanding a stronger influence on political decision making processes.##Supranational Institutions#Supranational institutions include both the EU and UNO and institutions such as the WHO, IMF, UNESCO and others. Giving power to these instutions means to demand and international decision or solution for an issue.##Own Nation#In contrast to giving power to supranational institutions, there may also be the call for a national solution. Conversely, a speaker may deny power to the own nation by the notion that an issue should not be decided on national level.##Other Actor#This is a residual category if power is attributed or denied to an actor other than a political one. For example, in Switzerland this could be the “Umweltverbände” (environmental associations) that have a “Verbandsbeschwerderecht” (veto right), meaning they can veto construction plans if they do not conform to environment legislation. As an example for a situation in which to code this: in 2008, there was a popular initiative trying to cut parts of these veto rights.#Please use this category only if none of the others apply!

[Act_Deny]
Which actor does the speaker DENY competence to act or decide?

[Iss_Central]
Which issue is the speaker evaluating?
You selected multiple issues. For which of them does the speaker take a position?
When multiple issues are selected because the overlap of several issues is the issue the speaker is talking about, the position for only one central issue may be coded. This central issue may be selected by the coder in the case of multiple issues.#The central issue is the issue the speaker is taking a position on.## - "I am for stricter regime concerning welfare for immigrants" Since the position is not for or against immigration but for a stricter welfare regime, the central issue would be the welfare regime in this statement. Nevertheless, the welfare for immigrants is an overlap between two issues.


[Iss_Pos]
Which position does the speaker express in relation to this issue?
Please indicate the speaker's explicitly expressed position if there is any.
Since each issue is a field of political debate, there are different positions an actor may take toward an issue. In the immigration debate, for example, an actor may be in favor or opposed to strict regulation of immigration. While the exact position and justification is difficult to divine from single statements, only a rough definition of the position of each actor is used.##Attention: # - If the position is not explicit in the current text but the politician is known by the coder to have a certain position, this position must not be coded. The same applies to mistakes in the text (i.e.: wrong position of an actor) which has to be coded as described not as it is in reality.# - It is possible that actors have an anti-anti position, e.g. if they oppose a strict regulation of immigration (also called anti-immigration), they are anti anti-immigration. However, this does not mean they have a pro-immigration position, they might just prefer the status-quo. It is thus important to always carefully consider if an actor has a pro/contra or a not-pro/not-contra position and choose the right option.


[Iss_Effect]
What kind of effects are mentioned or expected?
You indicated that the speaker discusses effects of the issue/situation/development. How are they evaluated?
When discussing the effects of a situation or development, a speaker may choose to evaluate these effects. Thereby, the situation or development itself is indirectly evaluated. By attributing negative effects to a situation, this situation is implicitly labelled harmful. Since this is not equal to the explicit position of the speaker, the effects are evaluated separately if present.
9:Neutral effects / Not applicable
-1:Mainly negative effects
0:Positive and negative effects
1:Mainly positive effects


[Iss_Just]
How does the Speaker Justify the position taken?
Please indicate the appropriate justification(s) if present.
When a speaker takes a position on an issue there are different ways to justify or argument this position. In contrast to the following categories of “argumentation”, “sourcing” and “rhetorics”, this refers to the specific content of an argumentative chain. In this content analysis the justification is not assessed on argument level but categorized to one or several general types of justification. These types are:# - Economic justification# - Moral Justification# - Previous Agreement# - Party Politics# - Peoples Will# - Common Sense##Economic Justification:#Economic justifications include arguments based on the cost, financial benefit, or economic impact of a given issue or position. This category is coded whenever the speaker makes financial or economic evaluations of the issue.##Moral/Value-based Justification:#Moral or value-based justifications include arguments on the morally right or wrong way to handle an issue. These arguments may contain references to social values such as universalism, benevolence, tradition, security, or self-direction. Central to these arguments is a reference to basic human values or moral.#3Ecologic Justification#Justifications based on ecologic considerations include arguments on the ecologic impact of an issue or position. The impact may concern the animals, plants, or climate of the region, country, or planet as a whole.##Previous decision/agreement#Justifications based on previous decisions include arguments on binding contracts, agreements, or promises made in the past. These agreements may have been made with other political actors, with other nations or with private persons. Any reference to previously made decisions which are leading to the current position of the actor are to be coded here.##Party Politics#Similar to previously made decisions, justifications based on party politics do not contain arguments on the issue itself but mainly on binding contracts which lead to the current position of the actor. Here, however, the decision is made within the party of the Speaker. Any reference to the imperative of a position given the current politics of the party are coded here.##Peoples Will/Demands#Justifications based on the will of the people include the expressed or implicit will of the people as the actor perceives it. Any justification of a position including the will of the people or electorate is coded in this category. ##Common Sense#Justifications based on an alleged “common sense”. These include references to common knowledge or a perceived common sense about an issue. The common sense refers to the good judgement of the people about issues under concern. It implies that no expertise is needed to take the right decision.This has to be explicitly in the text. For example, a politician might say that “everybody knows that…” or “it’s obvious from common sense that…” and so on. The justification is based on the fact that by applying simple common sense, one can only come to the same conclusion as the speaker.##Reason#Justifications based on reason. This differs from “common sense” insofar as the speaker does not just refer to the fact that “everybody knows that X”, but that “it is reasonable that X”. The justification is based on the fact that by applying pure reason and logic (“proper thinking”), one can only come to the same conclusion as the speaker.

[Argument]
What does the speaker base the argumentation on his position/evaluation on?
Please indicate the occurrence of argumentative patterns
When taking a position or making explicit statements on an issue, a speaker may employ different means of argumentation to enhance the effect of the statement. In contrast to the following categories of “sourcing” and “rhetorics”, and the category of “justification” before, this refers to the specific structure of an argumentative chain. In this analysis we differ between six broad categories of argumentation.##Single case#Arguing on the base of a single case or 'Exemplar' is a common form of argumentation on complex issues. Here, the speaker uses an exemplar to visualize a problem. The exemplar may thereby be a person or a group and it may be real or made up. It is irrelevant for the coding of this category whether the single case is actually existing or invented for the sake of the argument. Any argument basing on a person or group is to be coded in this category.##Generality#Arguing on the base of generality may especially be found when concrete problems are investigated and interpreted in a greater context. Here, the speaker uses a general rule, common knowledge or even a cliché to categorize a problem or a single case. The general rule does not have to be correct for this category to be coded. Whenever the argumentative pattern of deducing from generality is used, this category is coded. This also includes the argumentative fallacy of the 'True Scotsman' (an individual is excluded from generality because he would endanger a generalization).##Fallacy in counter-arguments#In some cases, the argumentation of a speaker is not centered on the validity of the own argument or position but on mistakes in arguments speaking against his own position. By virtue of falsifying the counter-arguments the speaker may try to enhance the perceived validity of own arguments. Here again, it is not important whether the counter-arguments have been formulated in this way by another actor. The category is coded whenever the argumentation of a speaker is based on the falsehood of other arguments. This also includes the argumentative fallacy 'Straw man' (a counter-argument is invented for the sake of disproving it).##Competence#A weak form of argumentation which may be used in spontaneous discussions is based on the incompetence of opponents or the competence of proponents of the own position. By denouncing persons who contradict the own position, the perceived validity of the own position may be enhanced. Likewise, expertise on the own side may be used to enhance credibility.#Attention: If the target of such an attribution of competence is an actor, the actor evaluation has to be coded separately afterwards.##Other issue#Especially in political debates on complex issues, the argumentation may be based on (suspected) implication on other issues. These issues may be unrelated and the suspected implication does not have to be reasonable for this category to be coded. The category is coded whenever the argumentation includes effects on other issues.#There are some argumentative fallacies which would also be coded in this category. Among them is the 'red herring'/'Nebelkerze' (introducing a new issue to divert attention) and the Gish gallop (introducing a multitude of issues to jam the discussion).##Causality/Logic#In many argumentations, causal chains or logic conclusions are used to demonstrate the validity of an argument. Causality always has the form 'A causes B'. This option does not have to be coded whenever the speaker mentions causes or effects of an issue. Only when the speaker justifies a position or evaluation using a causal attribution. The most frequent and important modes of logical reasoning are:# - Modus ponens: A causes B. A has happened, so B will happen.# - Negative Modus ponens: A causes B. B has not happened, so A did not happen. (also: A causes B, so we have to prevent A in order to prevent B)# - Modus Tollens: A or B is true. A is not true, so B has to be true.# - Syllogism: All A have property B. C is part of A, so C has property B.#This category also includes fallacies such as:# - Faulty Syllogism: All A have property B. All C have property B, so A and C are linked.# - "Invisible pink unicorn" / argument from ignorance: A has not been proven wrong, so it has to be true.# - Post hoc ergo propter hoc: A happened after B, so B caused A# - Cum ergo propter hoc: A and B are coincident. So A and B are connected.# - Galileo Gambit / Fulton Non Sequitur: A was disbelieved in the past but has been proven right. B is currently disbelieved so it will prove right.#Logical reasoning may very well be linked with any of the above types of argumentation. For example, a general rule is needed for a syllogism to be formulated.

[Sourcing]
Does the speaker name a source for his statement?
Please indicate which primary source the speaker refers to.
The source of a statement may be added to enhance credibility or for persuasive effects. A credible and trustworthy source prevents the audience (and opponents) from questioning the statements. Conversely, naming personal opinions as a source allows for counter-arguing but also indicated humility and the will to deliberate. In contrast to the following category of “rhetorics”, and the categories of “justification” and “argumentation” before, this refers to the specific source of an argumentative chain.#A source has to be mentioned explicitly by the actor for any claim he is making. Any claim that does not have an explicit source is coded as 'no source provided'##No Source provided# - The majority of the people is against this law'# - 60% der Asylbewerber haben HIV. (© Blick am Abend)# - Mehr als die Hälfte dieser Leute wollen aber gar nicht arbeiten.##Explicitly personal opinion/perspective# - 'I think the majority of the people is against this law'# - 'Also meiner Meinung nach...'# - 'Ich denke nicht, dass man das so sagen kann.'##Poll Data/Survey/Study#Referring to poll data shows the competence of an actor related to the issue he is speaking about, and on the other hand those references are mostly used to underline and legitimate the actors position. Furthermore, by referring to poll data, the actor may signalize that the attitudes of the people (or the majority of it) are of concern to him and guide him in is reasoning.# - 'A survey done by the university of Zurich has shown that the majority of the people is against this law'# - Die Umfragedaten von Gfs-Bern zeigen, dass die Mehrheit des Volkes … will.##Demographics / Facts & Figures# - Die GSS-Statistik zeigt, dass die Geburtenrate stark zurückgeht# - Laut BFS gehen immer mehr Frauen Arbeiten##Past Popular Vote#In some circumstances, the attitudes and opinions of the people may not only be assessed by means of poll data but also by means of past popular votes where the opinion of the majority is measured directly. # - 'The last popular vote on this issue has shown that the majority of the people is against this law'# - In der Abstimmung hat das Volk klar gezeigt, dass es für eine schnelle Ausschaffung von Kriminellen ist.##Experts#Experts may be scientists, politicians, or private persons which are explicitly referred to when making a statement. In most cases, these experts have knowledge on a specific field that surpasses most people's knowledge. This is, however, not a prerequisite for this category to be coded. All references to another person which supports the statement is coded as a reference to experts.# - Experten sind der Meinung, dass…# - Wie Christoph Blocher bereits an der letzten Klausur sagte, ist dies eines der grössten Probleme der Schweiz in der Gegenwart.#ATTENTION: If the expert is uttering a complete statement, he must also be coded as an individual speaker.##Laws / Regulations#If a speaker cites a specific law or a regulation as the source of a statement, use this category. # - ‘Since we cannot violate binding international laws, this popular initiative has to be declared invalid.’##Obscure Source#In some cases speakes may refer to 'figures', 'recent findings', or 'plans' without specifying the source. In these cases the speaker implies that there is a source without explicitly naming it.# - Man hat es vermutet, nun ist es durch Zahlen belegt:# - Many people say that there is a connection between these events.# - Current investigations confirmed this fact.# - Wie verschiedene Studien gezeigt haben,…##Press Release / Press Conference#If a speaker cites a press release or a press conference as the source of a statement, use this category. Press releases are all official statements which are delivered to the press by an actor (party, political entity, NGO or other organization, or person) to publish a statement. Press conferences  and written press releases are both coded in this category.# - ‘At the press release about their policy recommendations in the forefront of the election, the UKIP said that…’##Party Manifesto#If a speaker cites a party manifesto as the source of a statement, use this category. # - ‘Their party manifesto clearly states that they want to cut back welfare even more.’##Other Sources#Residual category for all other possible sources.

[Rhetoric]
How does the speaker argue in this statement?
In the whole statement of this actor, which of the following rhetorical elements are present in the statement?
Any statement may be put in different rhetoric styles. In this content analysis we are centrally interested in rhetoric styles which present an argument in an attacking, alarming or exaggerating manner. In contrast to the previous categories of “justification”, “argumentation” and “rhetorics” before, this refers to the specific style of an argumentative chain. We thereby distinguish between Absolutism, Morality, Sarcasm/Cynicism, Exaggeration, War Rhetoric, Emergency Rhetoric, and Scandalization. ##Absolutism#In this rhetorical figure something is either presented as the only conceivable option or as preposterous, off the scale, or unbearable. By means of enforcing rhetoric discarding any alternatives to the opinion voiced, the speaker refuses to acknowledge that anyone might disapprove.#Statements of this kind do not allow or invite any discussion or compromise. In German, the formulation "Es kann nicht sein" is typical for this kind of argument.##Immorality:#Morality refers to good (right), whereas Immorality refers to bad (wrong) behavior. Immorality as a rhetoric style highlights the incongruence of a situation, argument or policy with current societal norms, cultural values, or moral. ##Sarcasm/Cynicism/Irnoy/Ridicule#Sarcasm or cynicism is a rhetorical means used to refute arguments or discredit opponents by depicting them ridiculous or irrational. While there are other means to discredit opponents (e.g. insulting, dramatizing, scandalizing or stereotyping), sarcasm or cynicism is the only of them using a humorous tone. An exaggeration might thus be a dramatization as long as the actor presents a serious argument, but it is clearly cynical or sarcastic if the exaggeration is so much inflated that the argument becomes ridiculous. #Statements of this kind use irony, absurd exaggeration, cynicism or other humorous modes of speech to mock others. Crucial to this kind of polemic arguing is the attempt of the speaker to make his opponent, an argument or a policy to seem ridiculous or absurd. Rather than explicitly stating absurdity the critique is wrapped up in a witty or humorous statement which in itself is not to be taken serious.##Exaggeration#Exaggeration lives from the usage of superlatives both in adjectives ("worst case", "biggest problem") and adverbs ("utterly important" / "exceedingly strong"). Exaggeration does not include any usual amplifiers such as 'very'.##War Rhetoric#War Rhetoric refers to a manner of speech in which situations in politics are labelled as "war", "fight", "peace", "treaty", "turmoil" or other military expressions. It may also be employed by stating that something is "killed" which does not have a life (e.g: jobs, negotiations, efforts)##Emergency Rhetoric#Emercency Rhetoric refers to a manner of speech in which situations in politics are labelled as a crisis, plight, hardship or emergency, or when a speaker asks for an immediate/instant solution/change concerning a problem. This applies also to cases where an actual crisis (e.g.: financial crisis) is talked about. If someone mentions that there is some “urgent need for action” regarding an issue, it is also an indicator for emergency rhetoric.##Scandalization#Scandalization is a rhetorical means to declare something as a scandal by labelling it outrageous, scandalous, shocking or intolerable. While dramatization is the exaggeration of a problem referring to a crisis, scandalization is a valenced judgement and refers to a misbehavior of specific actors or to label situations as unbearable.  Political actors will use this rhetoric toward their opponents.##Rhetoric Question#Rhetoric questions are questions which are either not directed at a specific person or do not ask for any information. These questions may be used in texts to prompt the audience to elaborate on the argumentation. In mass communication any question within the text may be coded as 'rhetoric question' since any answers are technically impossible.#In dialogues rhetoric questions are only coded whenever the addressee of the question is not present or his answer is not waited for. Any concrete questions which are directed to a person which is given time to answer them is not coded as a rhetoric question.##Patriotism/Nationalism and National Symbolism#Patriotism/nationalism and national symbolism may be used as a rhetoric means by empahsizing the superiority of the own country. This may be expressed by references to historical events and developments, as well as current administration. These are references towards some obscure “heartland” of a specific nation. Please do only code these symbols if they are used in a patriotic/nationalist way! If a historian writes an article about the Siege of Vienna, it is not to be coded!

[Rhetoric_EW]
How does the speaker argue in this statement?
In the whole statement of this actor, which of the following rhetorical elements are present in the statement?
Any statement may be put in different rhetoric styles. In this content analysis we are centrally interested in rhetoric styles which present an argument in an attacking, alarming or exaggerating manner. In contrast to the previous categories of “justification”, “argumentation” and “rhetorics” before, this refers to the specific style of an argumentative chain. We thereby distinguish between Absolutism, Morality, Sarcasm/Cynicism, Exaggeration, War Rhetoric, Emergency Rhetoric, and Scandalization. ##Absolutism#In this rhetorical figure something is either presented as the only conceivable option or as preposterous, off the scale, or unbearable. By means of enforcing rhetoric discarding any alternatives to the opinion voiced, the speaker refuses to acknowledge that anyone might disapprove.#Statements of this kind do not allow or invite any discussion or compromise. In German, the formulation "Es kann nicht sein" is typical for this kind of argument.##Immorality:#Morality refers to good (right), whereas Immorality refers to bad (wrong) behavior. Immorality as a rhetoric style highlights the incongruence of a situation, argument or policy with current societal norms, cultural values, or moral. ##Sarcasm/Cynicism/Irnoy/Ridicule#Sarcasm or cynicism is a rhetorical means used to refute arguments or discredit opponents by depicting them ridiculous or irrational. While there are other means to discredit opponents (e.g. insulting, dramatizing, scandalizing or stereotyping), sarcasm or cynicism is the only of them using a humorous tone. An exaggeration might thus be a dramatization as long as the actor presents a serious argument, but it is clearly cynical or sarcastic if the exaggeration is so much inflated that the argument becomes ridiculous. #Statements of this kind use irony, absurd exaggeration, cynicism or other humorous modes of speech to mock others. Crucial to this kind of polemic arguing is the attempt of the speaker to make his opponent, an argument or a policy to seem ridiculous or absurd. Rather than explicitly stating absurdity the critique is wrapped up in a witty or humorous statement which in itself is not to be taken serious.##Exaggeration#Exaggeration lives from the usage of superlatives both in adjectives ("worst case", "biggest problem") and adverbs ("utterly important" / "exceedingly strong"). Exaggeration does not include any usual amplifiers such as 'very'.##War Rhetoric#War Rhetoric refers to a manner of speech in which situations in politics are labelled as "war", "fight", "peace", "treaty", "turmoil" or other military expressions. It may also be employed by stating that something is "killed" which does not have a life (e.g: jobs, negotiations, efforts)##Emergency Rhetoric#Emercency Rhetoric refers to a manner of speech in which situations in politics are labelled as a crisis, plight, hardship or emergency, or when a speaker asks for an immediate/instant solution/change concerning a problem. This applies also to cases where an actual crisis (e.g.: financial crisis) is talked about. If someone mentions that there is some “urgent need for action” regarding an issue, it is also an indicator for emergency rhetoric.##Scandalization#Scandalization is a rhetorical means to declare something as a scandal by labelling it outrageous, scandalous, shocking or intolerable. While dramatization is the exaggeration of a problem referring to a crisis, scandalization is a valenced judgement and refers to a misbehavior of specific actors or to label situations as unbearable.  Political actors will use this rhetoric toward their opponents.##Rhetoric Question#Rhetoric questions are questions which are either not directed at a specific person or do not ask for any information. These questions may be used in texts to prompt the audience to elaborate on the argumentation. In mass communication any question within the text may be coded as 'rhetoric question' since any answers are technically impossible.#In dialogues rhetoric questions are only coded whenever the addressee of the question is not present or his answer is not waited for. Any concrete questions which are directed to a person which is given time to answer them is not coded as a rhetoric question.##Patriotism/Nationalism and National Symbolism#Patriotism/nationalism and national symbolism may be used as a rhetoric means by empahsizing the superiority of the own country. This may be expressed by references to historical events and developments, as well as current administration. These are references towards some obscure “heartland” of a specific nation. Please do only code these symbols if they are used in a patriotic/nationalist way! If a historian writes an article about the Siege of Vienna, it is not to be coded!

[V_Cues]
Visual cues
Which of the following visual cues were offered by the speaker in this statement?
This category collects information about mimics and gestures of speakers. It bears some similarity to category 37 (emotion), but is a visual expression of it (emotions can only be coded if there’s an explicit reference to specific emotions!). Thus, this category can only be coded according to visual information. Code this category only for audio-visual TV-material! #There are two general types of visual cues: firstly, movements or gestures refer to actions that one does with his general body, most notably the arms and hands; secondly, mimics refer to action that one does with the face (facial expressions). This category is coded with dichotomous variables for the single values, thus it is possible to code more than one gesture/mimic per statement.##Movement: Gesticulating: #This first code means that the speaker is gesticulating with his arms and hands to underline a message he wants to convey.##Movement: Unrelated Action: #This codes encompasses all actions that a speaker does while speaking (that are not gesticulation or mimics), such as specific work procedures. For example, an office worker might be shown typing something into the keyboard while he utters his statement. Or a politician could be shown that is glancing at some papers before making his statement.##Mimics: Smiling: #The speaker is shown with a smile on his face. This involves a laughing face expression (corner of mouth are up, teeth are shown) accompanied with at least small laughing sounds. It must not necessarily express joy or happiness, but can also be an ironic, sarcastic and/or mischievous smile.##Mimics: Sad: #The speaker is shown with a sad expression on his face. This involves a sad face expression (corner of the mouth are down, the eyelids are dropped, holding back tears or crying) not necessarily accompanied with sobbing or crying.##Mimics: Angry / upset:#The speaker is shown with an angry and/or upset face. This involves an angry or upset face expression (eyebrows are pulled down and together, lips are narrowed, eyes are wide open or glaring) often accompanied with verbal outrage or cursing
gest:Movement: Gesticulating
action:Movement: Unrelated action
smile:Mimics: Smiling
sad:Mimics: Sadness
anger:Mimics: Angry / Upset


[Emot]
Is there any emotional appeal?
Does the actor argue emotionally? Does he explicitly name emotions?
Emotions strongly influence our behaviour and the systematic use of emotions is therefore a convenient means of political actors to influence the attitudes of the electorate. The use of emotions can be twofold: on the one hand political actors may show their own emotions, on the other hand they may evoke emotions among their audiences. Politicians can use emotions (e.g. fear, disgust, anger) to create distance to issues or groups, but also to generate closeness within a group (e.g. happiness, sadness, pity) (see Schmader and Lickl 2006 and Nabi 1999 below for approach and avoidance tendencies of emotions). Emotions may thus be used by populist actors to generate closeness to the good and distance to the bad. The use of an emotional style does not refer to the topic, but to the presentation of a topic. Is the topic presented in an emotional way by either showing emotional facial expressions and gestures or by an emotional reporting style using affective words, lots of adjectives, and references to the fate of individuals rather than to general consequences.##Schmader & Lickl 2006: “Approach and avoidance are two motivational orientations that govern behavior. Whereas approach motivation is associated with behavior designed to achieve positive goals, avoidance motivation is typically associated with behavior designed to avoid losses.” p. 43 “Traditionally, approach motivation has been thought to involve efforts to seek out positive affect while avoidance motivation has been thought to involve efforts to escape negative affect. However, recent research suggests that discrete emotions cannot be categorized by assuming that positive emotions are approach related and negative emotions are avoidance related. Certain negative emotions, such as fear, sadness, and disgust, elicit avoidance tendencies. However other negative emotions, such as anger, seem to be associated with approach tendencies (Harmon-Jones, 2004).” p.44##Nabi 1999: “Fear appears to be associated with the strongest avoidance reaction in terms of both responding to and thinking about the fear-evoking situation. Although the avoidance reactions of disgust, guilt, and sadness to a stimulus are rather moderate relative to fear, those experiencing disgust are the least likely to dwell on a situation compared to those experiencing sadness and especially those experiencing guilt, who exhibit a strong dwelling response. Finally, anger does not appear to stimulate any avoidance response to a stimulus and is associated with a moderate willingness to think about the situation, that is, less than sadness and guilt but more than fear and disgust. Because depth of information processing is likely a function of both the initial avoidance-approach response to the source and willingness to consider the situation in more detail, and though there is no evidence on which to base a definitive order for these emotions in terms of expected subsequent information-processing depth, itcan be asserted generally that those experiencing message-induced fear should be the least willing to closely process the remainder of a message, followed by those experiencing disgust and guilt (both of which are associated with some source avoidance tendencies). Those experiencing sadness and anger should be willing to process with some degree of attention, the extent of which would likely depend on other factors, like intensity of the emotional experience.” p. 305##Emotions are only coded if they are explicit, that is if a discrete emotion is named or shown (i.e. if someone laughs or cries). These rhetorical means are only coded in statements of actors.

###############

[Tgt_ID]
Does the speaker make a statement on any of these persons or groups?
If more than one statement on other actors is made you may code them successively
The target of a statement may be any actor, collective or abstract which is described, evaluated, or addressed by the speaker. This includes all specifically named actors (Persons, Organizations, States...), proportions of the population (e.g.: socioeconomic layers, ethnic groups, the people as a whole...) and the speaker himself.##Specific person#Any reference to a specific person may be coded in this category. For a select sample of major politicians, they may be coded exactly. Other political actors may be coded as members of their parties, other actors without any party affiliation may be coded as 'other actor'. A detailed list of all actors may be found in Appendices B to E: Actors.##Specific political party or coalition#Any reference to a specific political party or a coalition within the own country are coded as party. A detailed list of parties and coalitions for all countries under investigation may be found in Appendices B to E: Actors.##Multiple Persons#Any identical references to more than one specific person, party or coalition may be coded in this category. Therefore the coding of equivalent statements of one speaker about more than one target actor can be coded simultaneously. A detailed list of all actors and parties of all countries may be found in Appendices B to E: Actors.##People / Citizens / Commoners (also: Parts of the population)#References to the people are directed toward the whole of the society, population, nation, or people or to a specific part of this collective which is considered the true people. In some cases, the people may be addressed by means of an inclusive 'we' such as in 'we have to solve that problem together'. If this inclusive 'we' is explicitly addressed to the people (e.g: in the context of the sentence), this may be coded as unspecific reference to the people. If, however, the reference to the people is implicit and the speaker may as well refer to the own party or any other collective he is part of, the object of the statement has to be coded as unspecific notion of the 'Own Person'.##Elite (Political, Financial, Economic, Media, Unspecific)#Any kind of elite is coded with this category. The elite may thereby be the leading class in different sectors of the society. The political elite comprise all politicians, the executive, legislative, judicative, and administration.  The financial elite comprise all very rich persons and banks, the wealthy 1% of the population ("Die oberen 10'000"), or any other notion of influential rich persons. The economic elite comprises heads of companies, large enterprises, or employers. The media elite comprises all producers of mass media. Finally, there is an unspecific elite which is just referred to as the 'mighty ones' the 'ones behind the curtain' or 'the ones at the core of power'.##Supranational institution (IMF, EU, UNO,...)#Supranational institutions are institutions which are largely independent from single countries but act on a global or international level. This includes supranational political entities such as the EU or UN as well as specialized regulation institutions such as the IMF, the WHO, the WTO or UNESCO.##Foreign country / government#Foreign countries or foreign governments comprise all notions of foreign actors on a national level. Since the colloquial reference to the country in general, the population of the country, some actors within the country or the government is not distinguished (e.g. 'Die Deutschen kaufen wieder Steuer-CDs'), all references of this kind are subsumed under this category. Likewise, all references to foreign parties and politicians are coded here.##Own person#Any reference to the own person or family is coded in this category. This explicitly excludes any notion of the own party (>specific party) and the own people (>people). This does not include statements as 'I think' or 'In my opinion'. These phrases are only an indicator for the personal opinion as a Sourcing of the statement.##Other actor#Any (non political) person or group which is not covered by the list above may be coded as 'other actor' (e.g. celebrities). Multiple other actors may be coded as one if they do not differ in terms of attributions/description. The other actor may be defined later in an open question.

Specification of the people
Indicate whether the people is specified by the speaker in any form
The four categories 'Nation', 'Ethnos', 'Societal Layer', and 'Function' are definitions of the people as a whole. However, they are strongly dependent on the definition of people and especially of the definition of persons which do not belong to the people. In some languages there are words for these different definitions of the people. In most cases, however, the definition is only identifiable by the explicit exclusion of persons not belonging to the people. See the definitions of the sinlge categories for examples and language-specific cues.##In addition to these definitions of the people as a whole, there are many groups of sub-populiations within society which may be addressed. These groups are to be coded with categories 7 to 14.##Not specified: Any reference to 'the people' where the function, extent or meaning of this group of persons is not made explicit is coded as unspecified reference to the people. This includes the single notion of 'Schweizer' in Switzerland or 'Britons' in England without any contrast to other people, groups or nations. It also includes mentions of 'Some people' or 'Lots of people' (Ger: "Alle", "Die Leute").#People as a nation: Any reference to the people in contrast to persons and organizations outside the own country is coded as a nation. This definition of the people is always recognizable by references to international or foreign actors which are put in contrast to the people.#People as an ethnos: Any reference to the people in contrast to persons within the own country but of different origin is coded as ethnos. This also includes notions of the 'True Englishman', or the 'Urschweizer'/'Eidgenossen'.#People as a societal layer: Any reference to the people in contrast to persons within the own country but of different social standing (i.e: rich or poor) is coded as a societal layer. This includes notions of the 'working population' and the 'Proletariat'.#Hypothetical prototype of the people: Any reference to a hypothetical person representing the whole population as a prototype is coded as a hypothetical prototype. Please see the extended definition in style: Reference to the ‘common man’.#People as a function: Any reference to the people in a specific function within the society (e.g: voters, electorate, citizens, inhabitants) is coded as a function. This definition may either be identified by a contrast to the political elite or by the usage of a term describing a specific function (e.g: tax-payer, Wähler)#Majority: Any reference to the majority or large parts of the population (e.g: "Most of us...") is coded as reference to the majority.#Socioeconomic group: Any reference to a specific socioeconomic layer (e.g: rich people, poor people) is coded with this option. In contrast to 'People as a societal layer' this group is not considered to be the people (in contrast to another group) but just as a part of the population.#Origin group / Immigrants: Any reference to immigrants in general, a specific group of immigrants or explicitly native persons is coded with this option. This does not include mentions of the people as an ethnic group.#Religious, Age, Education, Ideology Group: Any reference to groups of people which only differ by a specific property from the rest of the population are coded with these options.#Unemployed Persons: Any reference to unemployed persons is coded with this specific option.#Other Specification: Any other part of the population or definition of the people is coded with this category.

[Embod]
Does the speaker claim to embody or represent the people?
Please indicate, whether the speaker refers to himself as embodiment or representation of the people's will.
Populist actors have a twofold self-concept which allows them to be a populist leader in spite of the strong aversion against leaders and elites in populist ideology. On the one hand, this self-concept holds that the leader is still a member of the people in spite of the current position within the political system. This part of the self-concept may be coded in the category Attribution of Relation to the People.#On the other hand, populist self-concept holds that the populist actor is not an actor in his own right longing for power (such as all other elites) but the necessary embodiment of the people's will within the political system. Therefore the populist actor represents the will of the people and does not pursue any own ambitions, aims or schemes. In order for this self-concept to work the populist leader has to claim that "the people" has one unified will or agreement which may be represented by him.#Stating that the will of the people is fragmented and the actor represents a proportion of the people (even the majority) may not be counted as populist strategy.
0:No claims
1:Claim to represent a part of the population
2:Claim to represent the whole (monolithic) people
3:Claim to embody the people


[Monolith]
Is the People referred to as a monolithic actor?
Please indicate whether the people (as specified above) shares a common will, opinion, feeling, or desire.
When referring to the people a speaker may differentiate between two concepts of the people. On one hand, there is a "monolithic people" who shares a common understanding of the world and has common feelings and desires. In this concept of the people, it is possible to speak of 'the will of the people' or 'the people's fears'. On the other hand, there is the concept of a fractured population of individuals with their own feelings, opinions, and desires which do disagree in some points.##Common feelings, desires, opinion#When treating the people as a monolithic actor, the people is described as exhibiting a common understanding of the world. This may be expressed by common feelings (such as fear or joy), common opinions (approvement / disapprovement), or a common will (demands, plans, orders to the government).#Important to this category is the absence of any relativization to the extent of this common feeling. There is no mention of certain shares of the people that think otherwise or would disagree.##Diverse feelings, desires, opinion#This category has to be coded as soon as there are any relativizing formulations which point toward a fractured opinion within the population. This may be either a qualitative information (e.g. some people / most of the people / many citizens) or quantitative information (e.g.: 57% of the people). This information to the extent of a common sharing of any feeling, desire or opinion implies that there are some individuals that might disagree.
9:Not explicitly defined

[Distance]
Which pronouns does the speaker use to talk about this actor?
Please indicate, whether the speaker uses the first (I, we, us), second (you, your), or third (they, them, he, she)
When talking about collective actors of which the speaker is a member, he may decide to talk of this actor in the first ("we"/"us") or third ("they"/"them") person. This distinction in perspective may be used to express the self-perception as being a part of the collective actor or just an observer. In political communication where actors simultaneously are a member of the people (by citizenship) of a party (by membership), the legislative or executive political sphere (by profession), the distinction between the first and third person when referring to these groups is especially important.#For example, a member of the parliament may use the first person when talking about the people and the third person when talking about politicians in order to express his self-perception as a member of the people. Conversely, he may use the third person when talking about the people and the first person when talking about the parliament to express a self-perception as politician.

[Iss_Link]
Is the evaluation of this actor linked to a previously coded Issue?
Please select from the list below
When evaluating or describing an actor this may be done based on a political issue or without any connection to concrete issues. In this content analysis we differentiate between statements on actors concerning political issues and statements on actors without any political reference. Therefore, each actor evaluation may be linked to an issue previously coded for this text.#If there is any link between the actor evaluation and an issue of the text, this link is to be coded. If there is a link to a previously coded issue, the issue can be chosen directly from the list. If there is a link to another not yet coded issue, the new linked issue must be specify in the next step. Only statements on actors without any reference to policy fields may be coded as 'No link to issues'.##When the evaluation of an actor is based on several issues mentioned before, the option 'Link to several issues' may be coded. In this case the issues will not be coded separately.
0:No link to Issue
1:Link to several issues
9:Link to other issue (please specify)

Which issue is the target linked to?
You indicates that the actor is linked to another issue. Please specify
When you specify the other issue, an empty issue will be created for this speaker. It contains neither elaboration nor position.


[Iss_Link_Pos]
You indicated a link to an issue. Is the position of this target toward the issue specified?
Please indicate the target's position as stated by the speaker if there is any.
If an issue is linked to the target, the position of the target (as indicated by the Speaker) is to be coded. Here, it is impossible to code the explicit position as the target itself does not make any explicit statement (or else it would be coded as speaker). So, the alleged position as indicated by the speaker is coded as the position of the target.



[Agreement]
Does the Speaker agree or disagree with the target?
Is a general or specific agreement or disagreement explicitly stated?
In addition to evaluating target actors with respect to personality attributes, impact, and actions, a speaker may also state agreement or disagreement with an actor, either generally or specifically.#General agreement would mean that the speaker points out that he agrees to a large part to the positions and opinions of the target actor. Specific disagreement, in contrast, is limited to a specific issue on which the actors agree or disagree.##Important: Agreement or disagreement is only to be coded if it is made explicit by the speaker. Just because a speaker has the same opinion as the target does not mean that the agreement is part of the statement of the speaker toward the target.

Is the power of the target discussed or described by the actor?
Please indicate whether they are attributed or denied by the speaker.
Next to the impact of actors, their power may also be discussed or evaluated by the speaker. Target actors may be described to gain, lose, or have power. At the same time the speaker may evaluate the right of certain target actors by stating that they should have more or less power.
gain:Gain Power / Increase Power
lose:Lose Power
have:Have Power


[Att_People]
How is the relation of this actor to the people described?
Please indicate whether these relations are attributed or denied by the speaker
Especially when talking about politcal actors or members of the Elite of the country, the connection to the people they represent, govern, employ, or influence is frequently debated. In this content analysis the ascribed connection of political actors to the people is of utmost importance since the link to the people is important for populist actors. For the media, the connection to the people or their readership is of high importance as well.#The relation to the people may be attributed on different levels either by another actor or by the speaker himself. In both cases the attribution will be coded.
belo:Belonging to the people
clos:Being close to the people
know:Knowing the needs of the people
care:Caring about people
beha:Speaking on behalf of the people
pow:Empowering the people
dece:Deceiving people


[Att_Act]
Which of these actions or statements are attributed to the actor?
Please indicate whether they are attributed or denied by the speaker.
Next to personality traits and supposed impact/accountability, certain actions may be attributed to an actor. These attributions or descriptions of actions may be used to describe the role of an actor to the public. This role may be positive or negative but is always active. In this content analysis, mainly negative or harmful actions are focused and distinguished, as these are the most abundant and (for the purpose of measuring populism and mediatization) central actions.
every:Performing everyday actions
symb:Performing symbolic / strategic actions
mist:Performing wrong/stupid action / Making mistake
right:Performing important/successful/right action
immo:Immoral/indecent behavior
crim:Criminal/Unlawful behavior
dem:Demanding something
prom:Promising something
plan:Planning / Striving / Scheming something
other:Other actions/statements



[Privat]
Privatization
Is there any statement on the privat life of the actor?
Privatization is a style focusing on personal issues and the private life of actors. It shifts the attention to personal issues rather than to political issues, despite of the fact that these might be irrelevant for the political performance of the actor (Rahat and Sheafer, 2007, p. 68). Privatization has to be coded whenever a reference to the personal live or private issues is made.##Family Life#This includes family relationships and all aspects of domestic life.##Biography / Way of life#This includes all biographical information, all information on the past of this target actor and his current way of life. It also includes any allusion to the current or past socioeconomic status of the target actor.##Leisure Time#This includes all information on leisure time like hobbies, vacations and recreational activities.##Love life#This includes all information on sexual relationships, marriage and divorce.
Fam:Reference to family life
Pas:Reference to biography / way of life
Lei:Reference to leisure time
Lov:Reference to love life


[PrivAtt]
Domain of the Attributes of this target
Are all the previously coded attributions predominantly related with the private/personal or professional life of the actor?
When talking about positive and negative attributes of a person these attributes may either concern their private or professional life. The distinction between personal and professional virtues and failures is especially interesting in the field of political communication where a strong interaction between these two parts of a politician's life is generally assumed. A politician who is not able to govern his own family or his own life is often considered unsuitable to govern a country. ##While these two sides of the life of a politician may be connected to each other, it is a question of rhetoric style which side is focused on when talking about an actor. Highlighting attributes of the private life (both positive and negative) is detached from concrete professional actions and thus may have a stronger and more enduring effect on the perception of this actor. 
-1:Predominantly professional life
0:Ambivalent/Mixed
1:Predominantly personal/private life


[Namecall]
Does the speaker use nicknames for the actor?
Any names which are not part of the christian name, last name, or function of the actor are considered nicknames
Sometimes speakers use nicknames to refer to certain actors. These names are recognizable by the audience and are most often judgmental. Nicknames may be any name an actor is called except from the official name of this actor. This includes diminutives and slight changes to the spelling of the name (e.g: “Charly Osborne”; “Barry O.” for Obama; “Angie” for Merkel) as well as the attachment of pre- and suffixes (e.g: “Problem-Peer”, “Mama Merkel”) and the creation of names not related to the actual name (e.g: “Twerp from Downing Steet” for Cameron).
0:No
1:Yes, positive
-1:Yes, negative
2:Yes, no clear valence


[Stereo]
Generalization
Does the actor generalize the attributes of this group or apply clichés and stereotypes?
Stereotyping or generalizing means applying attributes to all members of a given group because of their membership in this group. In this respect, all attributes ascribed to a certain group may be considered an implicit generalization. Apart from this implicit generalization, there is, however an explicit way of generalizing the attributes of members of groups which may be considered rhetorical style.#These generalizations do not only hold that a certain attribute applies to the members of a group but explicitly states that this attribute is either:# - A definitory element or qualifying attribute of this group (e.g: "Managers have to be greedy or else they would not be managers")# - An invariant attribute over time (e.g: "They have always been greedy and will ever be")# - An attribution which explicitly excludes exceptions (e.g.: "All of them are greedy")##Only explicit generalizations will be coded. These generalizations do not only connect an attribution to a group but raise the level of this attribution to a definition of the group itself. This style may therefore be considered a means of stressing a stereotype.
0:No
1:Yes
