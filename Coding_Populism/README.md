# Example-Project: Populism
The project in this folder was created for the semi-automated content analysis of populism in media coverage, press-relesases, and 
Social Media texts in 11 countries.

## Note on working with this tool:
The tool is based on an extensive codebook that assesses the content and style of texts in a large number of individual categories. The full documentation of these categories, their values, and their meaning is found in the codebook.pdf
If you want to import the data to SPSS, you may use the labeling syntax in this folder to label all variables and values.

## Note on compatibility
The angrist-tool runs on Python 2.7 and does not support Python 3.x. In case of inconvenience, compatibility may be achieved by changing the apply()-statement in the CMD class and removing all lines using print without brackets. Further, tkinter should be imported as Python 3.x module and the sub-libraries (tkfiledialog and tkmessagebox) have to be updated.
When working on Mac, I recommend using a windows emulator (e.g.: Wine).
